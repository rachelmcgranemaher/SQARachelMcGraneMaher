In this repository there is a class called Calculator that will show you some of the coding standards that have been provided in the handbook.
I made a branch off my master branch and called it stable_branch1
Committed my calculator class to the new branch 
made a pull request to merge the branch back into the master branch 
and then merged into master 
There is also a package called JUnit that has 2 classes one of which is called calculator1 and anotherthats called test1 these two classes will show you how to do unit testing
if the answers entered are correct the tests will pass and if the answers are incorrect the tests will not pass.
